## One Size Doesn't Fit All

I've seen too many developers try to force every project into the same rigid, step-by-step process. A simple portfolio website has vastly different needs than a complex SaaS platform. That's why I've built my approach to be a flexible framework, not a set of concrete steps.

My goal is to align with your vision, budget, and timeline, choosing the right tools and techniques for your specific project. This post pulls back the curtain on how I adapt my process to turn your idea into a high-quality, successful website.

## The Core Phases: A Flexible Journey

Think of these as adaptable phases rather than a strict timeline. The depth and duration of each phase depend entirely on the project's complexity.

### Phase 1: Discovery & Strategy

This is the most critical phase. Before writing a single line of code, we need to be perfectly aligned on what we're building and why.

- **For a portfolio or small business site:** This might be a single deep-dive call where we define goals, target audience, and scope.
- **For a startup or complex platform:** This could involve multiple workshops to map out user stories, technical architecture, and a long-term roadmap.

**Deliverable:** A clear project brief that ensures we're building the _right_ thing.

### Phase 2: The Visual Foundation (Design)

This is where my process differs most from traditional agencies. I'm a developer first, and I believe the design approach should match the project's goals. I don't force a custom design process when it isn't needed. We have three common paths:

- **Path A: Custom Design with a Specialist:** For projects needing a unique, brand-centric, and pixel-perfect look, I collaborate with a talented professional UI/UX designer I've worked with before. They translate your brand into a beautiful and functional design, which I then bring to life.
- **Path B: Inspired & Adapted Design:** Often, the best approach is to learn from the best. We'll look at top competitors and inspiring websites to identify proven layouts and user flows. I then adapt these ideas to create a professional and intuitive design that fits your brand without the timeline or budget of a fully custom process.
- **Path C: Component-Driven with Frontend Libraries:** When the primary focus is on functionality, speed, and a clean user interface (especially for internal tools or MVPs), we can leverage powerful frontend libraries (like Material UI, Ant Design, or Tailwind CSS). This allows us to build a robust, professional-looking application efficiently.

### Phase 3: The Build (Development)

This is where the vision becomes a reality. The complexity here varies wildly based on the project:

- **Frontend-focused sites (portfolios, marketing sites):** I'll build a fast, responsive, and SEO-friendly site using modern technologies.
- **Full-stack applications (SaaS, platforms, tools):** This is a more involved process where I build out the backend logic, database, APIs, and the frontend that users interact with.

Throughout this phase, I provide regular updates and a staging link so you can see the progress and provide feedback.

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance

No matter the project's size, rigorous testing is non-negotiable. I ensure everything works flawlessly across different browsers and devices. We'll check for bugs, broken links, and any usability issues. You'll have a chance to do your own testing and provide feedback before we go live.

### Phase 5: Launch & Evolution

Launching the site is just the beginning.

- **For some projects,** the launch marks the completion and handover.
- **For others, like a startup platform,** the launch is the starting line. We move into a cycle of gathering user feedback, iterating, and deploying new features.

I provide the training and support you need to manage your site, and I'm always available for ongoing maintenance, support, or future development phases.

## A Process Built Around You

My approach is built on transparency and adaptability. By choosing the right strategy, design path, and technology for your specific needs, we can build a website that not only looks great and functions perfectly but also achieves your business goals effectively and efficiently.
