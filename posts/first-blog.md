## The Stack Behind This Site

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ In this post, I'll break down the tech stack and key features powering my portfolio website.

## Core Technologies

### Next.js 13

The site is built using Next.js 14's app directory, leveraging both server and client components for optimal performance. The app directory structure gives us:

- Built-in routing
- Server-side rendering
- Optimized image handling
- API routes when needed

### Styling & Animations

- **Chakra UI**: Provides a robust component library and theming system
- **Framer Motion**: Handles smooth animations and transitions throughout the site

### Blog Engine

The blog you're reading right now is powered by:

- **gray-matter**: Parses frontmatter metadata from markdown files
- **react-syntax-highlighter**: Handles code blocks

```js
const example = "Like this one!";
```
